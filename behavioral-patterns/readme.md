# Behavioral Design Patterns
* Focus on interactions between cooperating objects
* Maintains as loose coupling (degree of interdependece between modules) as possible
* Increase flexibility in carrying the communication process

# Flyweight Pattern
* Conserves memory by sharing "expensive" (that requires much space) objects
* Flyweight objects are **inmutable** (unchangeable) - changes will affect other objects
* Benefit: reduce # of objects, decrease memory consumption, increase performance
* Structure
